Kerksieck,2022,Post-viral mental health sequelae in infected persons associated with COVID-19 and previous epidemics and pandemics: Systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence estimates,J Infect Public Health,"AIMS: Post-viral mental health problems (MHP) in COVID-19 patients and survivors were anticipated already during early stages of this pandemic. We aimed to synthesize the prevalence of the anxiety, depression, post-traumatic and general distress domain associated with virus epidemics since 2002. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase from 2002 to April 14, 2021 for peer-reviewed studies reporting prevalence of MHP in adults with laboratory-confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-1, H1N1, MERS-CoV, H7N9, Ebolavirus, or SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included studies that assessed post-viral MHP with validated and frequently used scales. A three-level random-effects meta-analysis for dependent effect sizes was conducted to account for multiple outcome reporting. We pooled MHP across all domains and separately by severity (above mild or moderate-to-severe) and by acute (one month), ongoing (one to three months), and post-illness stages (longer than three months). A meta-regression was conducted to test for moderating effects, particularly for exploring estimate differences between SARS-Cov-2 and previous pandemics and epidemics. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020194535. RESULTS: We identified 59 studies including between 14 and 1002 participants and providing 187 prevalence estimates. MHP, in general, decreased from acute to post-illness from 46.3% to 38.8% and for mild and moderate-to-severe from 22.3% to 18.8%, respectively. We found no evidence of moderating effects except for non-random sampling and H1N1 showing higher prevalence. There was a non-significant trend towards lower MHP for SARS-CoV-2 compared to previous epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: MHP prevalence estimates decreased over time but were still on a substantial level at post-illness. Post-viral mental health problems caused by SARS-CoV-2 could have been expected much earlier, given the previous post-viral sequelae."
2,M. Zur; T. Peselev; S. Yanko; V. Rotshild; I. Matok,2024,Efficacy and safety of antiviral treatments for symptomatic COVID-19 outpatients: Systematic review and network meta-analysis,Antiviral Res,"BACKGROUND: Remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are three antiviral agents approved by FDA emergency authorization for treating mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 adult outpatients at high risk for hospitalization and death. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of these antivirals based on updated published RCT and real-world data. STUDY DESIGN: This systematic review followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis framework guidelines. We searched all publications up to January 2023. RRs and 95% CIs for death, hospitalization, and adverse events were calculated. RESULTS: Six RCTs and seven cohort studies were included, with 1,456,523 participants, of whom 50,979 were treated with antivirals. Remdesivir was associated with the lowest probability of hospitalization and death compared to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir (P-scores 0.99 and 0.90, respectively, for remdesivir, 0.64 and 0.55, respectively for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, and 0.26 and 0.49, respectively for molnupiravir). Based on indirect comparisons, remdesivir was associated with a statistically significant decreased risk for hospitalization compared to molnupiravir (RR 0.09; 95% CI 0.02-0.40) and to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (RR 0.11; 95% CI 0.03-0.73). No statistically significant difference was found between antivirals in the mortality risk reduction and the risk for side effects. CONCLUSIONS: This is the most comprehensive network meta-analysis integrating RCTs and real-world data. In our indirect comparison, remdesivir was associated with the highest efficacy in preventing hospitalization among high risk symptomatic COVID-19 outpatients, compared to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir. This finding supports current guidelines, and may have importance when deciding which antiviral to use, together with other important factors."
3,X. Zuo; Y. Chen; L. Ohno-Machado; H. Xu,2021,How do we share data in COVID-19 research? A systematic review of COVID-19 datasets in PubMed Central Articles,Brief Bioinform,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims at reviewing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) datasets extracted from PubMed Central articles, thus providing quantitative analysis to answer questions related to dataset contents, accessibility and citations. METHODS: We downloaded COVID-19-related full-text articles published until 31 May 2020 from PubMed Central. Dataset URL links mentioned in full-text articles were extracted, and each dataset was manually reviewed to provide information on 10 variables: (1) type of the dataset, (2) geographic region where the data were collected, (3) whether the dataset was immediately downloadable, (4) format of the dataset files, (5) where the dataset was hosted, (6) whether the dataset was updated regularly, (7) the type of license used, (8) whether the metadata were explicitly provided, (9) whether there was a PubMed Central paper describing the dataset and (10) the number of times the dataset was cited by PubMed Central articles. Descriptive statistics about these seven variables were reported for all extracted datasets. RESULTS: We found that 28.5% of 12 324 COVID-19 full-text articles in PubMed Central provided at least one dataset link. In total, 128 unique dataset links were mentioned in 12 324 COVID-19 full text articles in PubMed Central. Further analysis showed that epidemiological datasets accounted for the largest portion (53.9%) in the dataset collection, and most datasets (84.4%) were available for immediate download. GitHub was the most popular repository for hosting COVID-19 datasets. CSV, XLSX and JSON were the most popular data formats. Additionally, citation patterns of COVID-19 datasets varied depending on specific datasets. CONCLUSION: PubMed Central articles are an important source of COVID-19 datasets, but there is significant heterogeneity in the way these datasets are mentioned, shared, updated and cited."

García López,2023,Restrictions on Hospital Referrals from Long-Term Care Homes in Madrid and COVID-19 Mortality from March to June 2020: A Systematic Review of Studies Conducted in Spain,Epidemiologia (Basel),"In March 2020, a ministerial directive issued by the Government of the Community of Madrid (CoM) in Spain included disability-based exclusion criteria and recommendations against hospital referral of patients with respiratory conditions living in long-term care homes (LTCHs). Our objective was to assess whether the hospitalization mortality ratio (HMR) is greater than unity, as would be expected had the more severe COVID-19 cases been hospitalized. Thirteen research publications were identified in this systematic review of mortality by place of death of COVID-19-diagnosed LTCH residents in Spain. In the two CoM studies, the HMRs were 0.9 (95%CI 0.8;1.1) and 0.7 (95%CI 0.5;0.9), respectively. Outside of the CoM, in 9 out of 11 studies, the reported HMRs were between 1.7 and 5, with lower 95% CI limits over one. Evaluation of the disability-based triage of LTCH residents during March-April 2020 in public hospitals in the CoM should be conducted."

Thabane,2023,"Evaluating interactive weekly mobile phone text messaging plus motivational interviewing for breastfeeding promotion among women living with HIV, giving normal birth at a primary healthcare facility in South Africa: a feasibility randomised controlled trial",BMJ Open,"OBJECTIVES: We assessed the feasibility of an appropriately powered randomised trial by evaluating whether participants could be recruited and retained, and sought preliminary information on exclusive breastfeeding rates. SETTING: Primary healthcare facility, serving a rural community. PARTICIPANTS: Women initiating breast feeding within 24 hours of giving birth, on antiretroviral treatment and aged ≥18 years. INTERVENTIONS: We randomised mother-infant pairs to receive weekly text messaging encouraging exclusive breast feeding plus in-person individual motivational interviews post partum at weeks 2, 6 and 10, or standard infant feeding counselling. OUTCOME MEASURES: The feasibility endpoints included number of participants who consented to participate and number with complete evaluation of infant feeding practices at study visits. Exploratory endpoints included number of participants who exclusively breast fed at 24 weeks post partum and number of participants adhering to study protocol. RESULTS: Of 123 mothers screened, 52 participants consented for participation. We recruited an average of five participants per month over 11 months. Most participants were unemployed (75%), had some high school education (84%) and had disclosed their HIV status to someone close (88%). About 65% participants completed outcome evaluation at week 10, decreasing to 35% at week 24. Twenty participants had the week 24 visit planned between 20 March and August 2020, during COVID-19 lockdown. Of these, 4 completed the visit telephonically, 16 were lost to follow-up. Exclusive breastfeeding rate remained relatively high across both groups through week 24. The difference in exclusive breastfeeding rates between the intervention and control groups was minimal: rate difference 22.2% (95% CI -20.1% to 64.5%). CONCLUSIONS: With a large eligible target population, recruitment targets could be achieved for a large trial. Strategies to retain participants, such as remote monitoring and in-person follow-up visits, will be essential. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov Registry (NCT02949713) and Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR201611001855404)."

Riedel-Heller,2024,A multidomain intervention against cognitive decline in an at-risk-population in Germany: Results from the cluster-randomized AgeWell.de trial,Alzheimers Dement,"INTRODUCTION: We investigated the effectiveness of a multidomain intervention to preserve cognitive function in older adults at risk for dementia in Germany in a cluster-randomized trial. METHODS: Individuals with a Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE) risk score ≥ 9 aged 60 to 77 years were recruited. After randomization of their general practitioner (GP), patients received a multidomain intervention (including optimization of nutrition and medication, and physical, social, and cognitive activity) or general health advice and GP treatment as usual over 24 months. Primary outcome was global cognitive performance (composite z score, based on domain-specific neuropsychological tests). RESULTS: Of 1030 participants at baseline, n = 819 completed the 24-month follow-up assessment. No differences regarding global cognitive performance (average marginal effect = 0.010, 95% confidence interval: -0.113, 0.133) were found between groups at follow-up. Perceived restrictions in intervention conduct by the COVID-19 pandemic did not impact intervention effectiveness. DISCUSSION: The intervention did not improve global cognitive performance. HIGHLIGHTS: Overall, no intervention effects on global cognitive performance were detected. The multidomain intervention improved health-related quality of life in the total sample. In women, the multidomain intervention reduced depressive symptoms. The intervention was completed during the COVID-19 pandemic."

Rostami,2023,Strongyloides coinfection in COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroids: A systematic review,Rev Med Virol,"The COVID-19 pandemic linked to the virus SARS-CoV-2, which began in China, affected ∼765 million people as of 30 April 2023. The widespread use of corticosteroids for the symptomatic treatment of COVID-19 could lead to the reactivation of infections of opportunistic pathogens, including Strongyloides. We sought to determine the clinical symptoms and demographic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-Strongyloides co-infection, particularly in patients with severe disease and being treated with immunosuppressive drugs. To do this, we undertook a systematic review of the literature, and searched public accessible scientific databases-the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/Medline and Embase -for eligible studies (1 December 2019 to 30 August 2022). The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022377062). Descriptive statistical analyses were used to present the clinical and laboratory parameters of the co-infection; for this, we calculated prevalence using the following formula: positive cases/total number of cases × 100. Of a total of 593 studies identified, 17 studies reporting 26 co-infected patients met the criteria for inclusion in this review. The median age of these patients was 55.14 years. Most of cases (53.8%) were treated with dexamethasone, followed by methylprednisolone (26.9%). Eighteen of 26 patients were immigrants living in European countries or the USA; most of these immigrants originated from Latin America (58%) and South-East Asia (11%). The commonest symptoms of co-infection were abdominal pain (50%), fever (46.1%), dyspnoea (30.7%) and cough (30.7%), and frequently reported laboratory findings were high absolute eosinophil count (38.4%), high white blood cell count (30.7%), high C-reactive protein (23.0%) and high neutrophil count (19.2%). Two of the 26 patients (7.7%) had fatal outcomes. Most of the SARS-CoV-2-Strongyloides coinfected cases were immigrants living in developed countries, emphasising the need for clinicians in these countries to be aware of clinical and laboratory parameters associated with such co-infections, as well as the key importance of rapid and accurate diagnostic tests for timely and effective diagnosis and patient management."

Najafi,2023,Electrical stimulation to regain lower extremity muscle perfusion and endurance in patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2: A randomized controlled trial,Physiol Rep,"Muscle deconditioning and impaired vascular function in the lower extremities (LE) are among the long-term symptoms experienced by COVID-19 patients with a history of severe illness. These symptoms are part of the post-acute sequelae of Sars-CoV-2 (PASC) and currently lack evidence-based treatment. To investigate the efficacy of lower extremity electrical stimulation (E-Stim) in addressing PASC-related muscle deconditioning, we conducted a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Eighteen (n = 18) patients with LE muscle deconditioning were randomly assigned to either the intervention (IG) or the control (CG) group, resulting in 36 LE being assessed. Both groups received daily 1 h E-Stim on both gastrocnemius muscles for 4 weeks, with the device functional in the IG and nonfunctional in the CG. Changes in plantar oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) and gastrocnemius muscle endurance (GNMe) in response to 4 weeks of daily 1 h E-Stim were assessed. At each study visit, outcomes were measured at onset (t(0) ), 60 min (t(60) ), and 10 min after E-Stim therapy (t(70) ) by recording ΔOxyHb with near-infrared spectroscopy. ΔGNMe was measured with surface electromyography at two time intervals: 0-5 min (Intv(1) ) and: 55-60 min (Intv(2) ). Baseline OxyHb decreased in both groups at t(60) (IG: p = 0.046; CG: p = 0.026) and t(70) (IG = p = 0.021; CG: p = 0.060) from t(0) . At 4 weeks, the IG's OxyHb increased from t(60) to t(70) (p < 0.001), while the CG's decreased (p = 0.003). The IG had higher ΔOxyHb values than the CG at t(70) (p = 0.004). Baseline GNMe did not increase in either group from Intv(1) to Intv(2) . At 4 weeks, the IG's GNMe increased (p = 0.031), whereas the CG did not change. There was a significant association between ΔOxyHb and ΔGNMe (r = 0.628, p = 0.003) at 4 weeks in the IG. In conclusion, E-Stim can improve muscle perfusion and muscle endurance in individuals with PASC experiencing LE muscle deconditioning."
9,M. Zuin; L. Roncon; G. Zuliani,2022,Echocardiographic systolic pulmonary arterial pressure and mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 patients,J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),"AIMS: We perfromed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the echocardiographic systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) difference between COVID-19 survivors (S) and nonsurvivors (NS). METHODS: MEDLINE and Scopus databases were systematically searched for articles, published in English language, from inception through 15 May 2021 using the following Medical Subject Heading (MESH) terms: COVID-19 [Title/Abstract] AND pulmonary arterial pressure [Title/ Abstract] OR Echocardiography [Title/Abstract]. The difference of sPAP measurement obtained at transthoracic echocardiography between nonsurvivors and survivors was expressed as mean difference with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effect model. RESULTS: Nine studies, enrolling 788 patients (mean age 62.8 years old, 479,men) met the inclusion criteria and were included into the analysis. Using a randomeffect mode, sPAP was 11.8mmHg (95% CI, 6.60-16.97; P < 0.0001, I2 = 89.3%) higher in NS compared with S. Sensitivity analysis confirmed yielded results. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 NS had a higher sPAP compared with S, reinforcing previous observations demonstrating the critical role of RV function in determining the short-term outcome of COVID-19 patients."
10,M. Zuin; G. Rigatelli; L. Roncon; G. Zuliani,2021,Relationship between echocardiographic tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and mortality in COVID-19 patients: A Meta-analysis,Echocardiography,"BACKGROUND: The evaluation of the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is recommended to assess the right ventricular (RV) systolic function. We performed an updated meta-analysis of the association between TAPSE and short-term mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: MEDLINE and Scopus databases were searched to locate all the articles published up to May 1, 2021, reporting data on TAPSE among COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors. The difference of TAPSE between the two groups was expressed as mean difference (MD) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects model. Both Q value and I(2) statistics were used to assess heterogeneity across studies. Sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, and evaluation of bias were performed. RESULTS: Twelve studies, enrolling 1272 COVID-19 patients (778 males, mean age 69.3 years), met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Non-survivors had a lower TAPSE compared to survivors (MD =  -3.089 mm, 95% CI =  -4.087 to -2.091, p < 0.0001, I(2 ) = 79.0%). Both the visual inspection of the funnel plot and the Egger's tests (t = 1.195, p = 0.259) revealed no evidence of publication bias. Sensitivity analysis confirmed yielded results. Meta-regression analysis evidenced that the difference in TAPSE between the two groups was only influenced by pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 non-survivors have a lower TAPSE when compared to survivors, especially in COPD subjects. Current data suggest that the TAPSE assessment may provide useful information regarding the short-term prognosis of COVID-19 patients during the infection."
11,M. Zuin; G. Rigatelli; L. Roncon; G. Pasquetto; C. Bilato,2023,Risk of incident heart failure after COVID-19 recovery: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Heart Fail Rev,"Patients recovered from COVID-19 have an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and heart structural changes. The aim of the present manuscript is to assess the risk of incident heart failure (HF) after COVID-19 infection. Data were obtained searching MEDLINE and Scopus for all studies published at any time up to September 1, 2022 reporting the risk of incident HF in COVID-19 recovered patients. The cumulative post-COVID-19 incidence and risk of incident HF were pooled using a random effects model and presented with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I(2) statistic. Overall, 21,463,173 patients (mean age 54.5 years, 58.7% males) were analyzed. Among them, 1,628,424 had confirmed COVID-19 infection while the remaining 19,834,749 represented the controls. The mean length of follow-up was 9.2 months. A random effect model revealed a pooled incidence of post COVID-19 HF in 1.1% of cases (95% CI: 0.7-1.6, I(2): 99.8%). Moreover, recovered COVID-19 patients showed an increased risk of incident HF (HR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.54-3.24, p < 0.0001, I(2) = 96.5%) in the same follow-up period. Meta-regression showed a direct relationship for the risk of incident HF using age (p = 0.001) and hypertension (HT) (p = 0.02) as moderators, while an inverse association was observed when the follow-up length was adopted as moderating variable (p = 0.01). COVID-19 survivors had an additional 90% risk of developing HF after COVID-19 infection in the long-term period. This risk was directly related with age and previous history of HT especially in the early post-acute phase of the infection."

Roncon,2023,Prevalence of pre-existing peripheral artery disease in COVID-19 patients and relative mortality risk: Systematic review and meta-analysis,Vascular,"INTRODUCTION: This study aims to assess prevalence and prognostic implications of pre-existing peripheral artery disease (PAD) in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Scopus to locate all the articles published up to 10 December 2021, reporting data on pre-existing PAD among COVID-19 survivors (S) and non survivors (NS). The pooled prevalence of pre-existing PAD in COVID-19 patients was calculated using a random effects model and presenting the related 95% confidence interval (CI), while the mortality risk was estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) and related 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Eight investigations, enrolling 13,776 COVID-19 patients (mean age: 67.1 years, 3.863 males), met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of pre-existing PAD was 5.7% of cases (95% CI: 3.8-8.4%, p < 0.0001), with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 84.5%), which was directly correlated with age (p < 0.0001), previous hypertension (p = 0.003), and dyslipidaemia (p = 0.02) as demonstrated by the meta-regression. Moreover, pre-existing PAD was significantly associated with higher risk of short-term death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR: 2.78, 95% CI: 2.37-3.27, p < 0.0001 I(2) = 0%); the sensitivity analysis confirmed yielded results. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing PAD represents a comorbidity in about 1 out of 6 COVID-19 patients, but it is associated with a twofold higher risk of short-term mortality."

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients with preexisting CAD. We searched Medline and Scopus to locate all articles published up to December 8, 2021, reporting data of COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors with preexisting CAD. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) as the effect measure with the related 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies including 27 435 patients (mean age 61.5 and 70.9 years) were analysed. The pooled prevalence of preexisting CAD was 12.6% (95% CI: 11.2-16.5%, I2 : 95.6%), and resulted as higher in intensive care unit patients (17.5%, 95% CI: 11.9-25.1, I2 : 88.4%) and in European cohorts (13.1%, 95% CI: 7.8-21.6%, P  < 0.001, I2 : 98.4%). COVID-19 patients with preexisting CAD had a two-fold risk of short-term mortality (OR 2.61, 95% CI 2.10-3.24, P  < 0.001, I2  = 73.6%); this risk was higher among Asian cohorts (OR: 2.66, 95% CI: 1.79-3.90, P  < 0.001, I2 : 77.3%) compared with European (OR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.90-3.14, P  < 0.001, I2 : 56.9%) and American (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.41-2.44, P  < 0.001, I2 : 0%) populations. The association between CAD and poor short-term prognosis was influenced by age, prevalence of hypertension (HT), DM and CKD. CONCLUSIONS: Preexisting CAD is present in approximately 1 in 10 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and significantly associated with an increased risk of short-term mortality, which is influenced by age, HT, DM and CKD."

Zuliani,2022,COVID-19 patients with acute pulmonary embolism have a higher mortality risk: systematic review and meta-analysis based on Italian cohorts,J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),"BACKGROUND: Acute pulmonary embolism has been recognized as a frequent complication of COVID-19 infection influencing the clinical course and outcomes of these patients. OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the mortality risk in COVID-19 Italian patients complicated by acute pulmonary embolism in the short-term period. METHODS: The study was performed in accordance with the Preferred Report Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. PubMed-MEDLINE and Scopus databases were systematically searched for articles, published in the English language and enrolling Italian cohorts with confirmed COVID-19 infection from inception through 20 October 2021. Mortality risk data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio as the effect measure with 95% confidence interval. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Higgins and Thomson I2 statistic. RESULTS: Eight investigations enrolling 1.681 patients (mean age 64.9 years, 1125 males) met the inclusion criteria and were considered for the analysis. A random-effect model showed that acute pulmonary embolism was present in 19.0% of Italian patients with COVID-19 infection. Moreover, these patients were at higher mortality risk compared with those without (odds ratio: 1.76, 95% confidence interval: 1.26-2.47, P  = 0.001, I2  = 0%). Sensitivity analysis confirmed yielded results. CONCLUSION: In Italian patients with COVID-19 infection, acute pulmonary embolism was present in about one out of five and significantly associated with a higher mortality risk in the short-term period. The identification of acute pulmonary embolism in these patients remains critical to promptly identify vulnerable populations who would require prioritization in treatment and prevention and close monitoring."

Sinagra,2023,One-Year Risk of Myocarditis After COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,Can J Cardiol,"BACKGROUND: Acute myocarditis has been described as a relatively rare cardiovascular complication of COVID-19 infection. However, data regarding the risk of myocarditis during the post-acute phase of COVID-19 are scant. We assess the risk of incident myocarditis in COVID-19 survivors within 1 year from the index infection by a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data. METHODS: Data were obtained by searching Medline and Scopus for all studies published at any time up to September 1, 2022, and reporting the long-term risk of incident myocarditis in COVID-19 survivors. Myocarditis risk data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models with hazard ratio (HR) as the effect measure with 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the Higgins-Thompson I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Overall, 20,875,843 patients (mean age 56.1 years, 59.1% male) were included in this analysis. Of them, 1,245,167 experienced (and survived) COVID-19 infection. Over a mean follow-up of 9.5 months, myocarditis occurred to 0.21 (95% CI 0.13-0.42) out of 1000 patients survived to COVID-19 infection compared with 0.09 [95% CI 0.07-0.12) out of 1000 control subjects. Pooled analysis revealed that recovered COVID-19 patients presented an increased risk of incident myocarditis (HR 5.16, 95% CI 3.87-6.89; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 7.9%) within 1 year from the index infection. The sensitivity analysis confirmed yielded results. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that myocarditis represents a relatively rare but important post-acute COVID-19 sequelae."

Risk data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with Hazard ratio (HR) as the effect measure with 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Overall, 19,293,346 patients (mean age 54.6 years, 54.6% males) were included in this analysis. Of them, 758,698 survived to COVID-19 infection. Over a mean follow-up of 6.8 months, new-onset HT occurred to 12.7 [95% CI 11.4-13.5] out of 1000 patients survived to COVID-19 infection compared to 8.17 [95% CI 7.34-8.53] out of 1000 control subjects. Pooled analysis revealed that recovered COVID-19 patients presented an increased risk of new-onset HT (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.46-1.97, p < 0.0001, I(2) = 78.9%) within seven months. This risk was directly influenced by age (p = 0.001), female sex (p = 0.03) and cancer (p < 0.0001) while an indirect association was observed using the follow-up length as moderator (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that new-onset HT represents an important post-acute COVID-19 sequelae."

Bilato,2023,Increased risk of acute myocardial infarction after COVID-19 recovery: A systematic review and meta-analysis,Int J Cardiol,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have analyzed the incidence and the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the post-acute phase of COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence and risk of AMI in COVID-19 survivors after SARS-CoV-2 infection by a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data. METHODS: Data were obtained searching MEDLINE and Scopus for all studies published at any time up to September 1, 2022 and reporting the risk of incident AMI in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection. AMI risk was evaluated using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with Hazard ratio (HR) as the effect measure with 95% confidence interval (CI) while heterogeneity was assessed using Higgins and Thomson I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Among 2765 articles obtained by our search strategy, four studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria for a total of 20,875,843 patients (mean age 56.1 years, 59.1% males). Of them, 1,244,604 had COVID-19 infection. Over a mean follow-up of 8.5 months, among COVID-19 recovered patients AMI occurred in 3.5 cases per 1.000 individuals compared to 2.02 cases per 1.000 individuals in the control cohort, defined as those who did not experience COVID-19 infection in the same period). COVID-19 patients showed an increased risk of incident AMI (HR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.65-2.26, p < 0.0001, I(2) = 83.5%). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that the risk of AMI was directly associated with age (p = 0.01) and male gender (p = 0.001), while an indirect relationship was observed when the length of follow-up was utilized as moderator (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 recovered patients had an increased risk of AMI."

Cattelan,2023,Risk of ischemic stroke in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis,Eur Stroke J,"BACKGROUND: Data regarding the risk of ischemic stroke within 1 year after the post-acute phase of COVID-19 remain scant. We assess the risk of ischemic stroke in COVID-19 survivors after SARS-CoV-2 infection by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data. METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we searched Medline and Scopus to locate all articles published up to February 11, 2023, reporting the risk of incident ischemic stroke in adult patients recovered from COVID-19 infection compared to non-infected patients (controls) defined as those who did not experience the infection over the same follow-up period. Ischemic stroke risk was evaluated using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with adjusted Hazard ratio (HR) as the effect measure with 95% confidence interval (CI) while heterogeneity was assessed using Higgins I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Overall, 23,559,428 patients (mean age 56, 1 year, 54.3% males), of whom 1,595,984 had COVID-19, were included. Over a mean follow-up of 9.2 months, ischemic stroke occurred in 4.40 [95% CI: 4.36-4.43] out of 1000 patients survived to COVID-19 compared to 3.25 [95% CI:3.21-3.29] out of 1000 controls. Recovered COVID-19 patients presented a higher risk of ischemic stroke ((HR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.75-2.41, p < 0.0001, I(2) = 63.7%) compared to people who did not have COVID-19. COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the time of the infection have a subsequent higher risk of stroke during the follow-up compared to those non-hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Recovered COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of ischemic stroke compared to subjects from the general population within 9 months from the index infection."

Bilato,2023,Risk of incident pericarditis after coronavirus disease 2019 recovery: a systematic review and meta-analysis,J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),"AIMS: Data regarding the risk of incident pericarditis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recovered patients are lacking. We determined the risk of incident pericarditis after COVID-19 infection by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of available data. METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we searched MEDLINE and Scopus to locate all articles published up to 11 February 2023 reporting the risk of incident pericarditis in patients who had recovered from COVID-19 infection compared to noninfected patients (controls) defined as those who did not experience the disease over the same follow-up period. Pericarditis risk was evaluated using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with hazard ratio (HR) as the effect measure with 95% confidence interval (CI) while heterogeneity was assessed using Higgins I2 statistic. RESULTS: Overall, 16 412 495 patients (mean age 55.1 years, 76.8% males), of whom 1 225 715 had COVID-19 infection, were included. Over a mean follow-up of 9.6 months, pericarditis occurred in 3.40 (95% CI: 3.39-3.41) out of 1000 patients who survived COVID-19 infection compared with 0.82 (95% CI: 0.80-0.83) out of 1000 control patients. Recovered COVID-19 patients presented a higher risk of incident pericarditis (HR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.56-2.43, I2 : 71.1%) compared with controls. Meta-regression analysis showed a significant direct relationship for the risk of incident pericarditis using HT ( P  = 0.02) and male sex ( P  = 0.02) as moderators, while an indirect association was observed when age ( P  = 0.01) and the follow-up length ( P  = 0.02) were adopted as moderating variables. CONCLUSIONS: Recovered COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of pericarditis compared with patients from the general population."

Zuliani,2021,Viral Load Difference between Symptomatic and Asymptomatic COVID-19 Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Infect Dis Rep,"We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the possible difference in the SARS-CoV-2 viral load between asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar for all investigations in the English language, reporting data on the threshold cycle (C(t)) from real-time RT-PCR assays for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) SARS-CoV-2 genes in asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Results: Overall, 703 COVID-19 patients (553 symptomatic and 150 asymptomatic) were analyzed. Five investigations reported the mean age of patients, evidencing that asymptomatic patients were younger than symptomatic patients (34.0 vs. 40.3 years, respectively). Pooled data regarding the levels of expression of the RdRp gene revealed no significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Similarly, no differences were observed comparing the mean C(t) values for the E and N genes. Based on real-time RT-PCR data, no differences exist in the viral load between symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 subjects considering C(t) values for RdRp, E and N genes' expression. Asymptomatic subjects may represent a reservoir of the infection and significantly contribute to the maintenance of the pandemic."
